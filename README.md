# My Virtual Machine
Are you on a different computer than yours and you want to get your terminal environment?

* Get a provisioner ([Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* [Get Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Get the code at [https://github.com/affo/vim](https://github.com/affo/vim)

Then, in `vmine`'s directory:

```
$ vagrant up # wait for the VM to be up
$ vagrant ssh
```

Or something like this (I'm thinking of you, Windows).
